# Project Context: Virtual HR Interview Practice Bot

## Project Name
**Virtual HR Interview Practice Bot**

## Project Overview
The "Virtual HR Interview Practice Bot" is an AI-powered web application that simulates real-world HR interviews for users preparing for job opportunities. The bot asks relevant questions based on the job role and experience level selected by the user. After answering, the bot evaluates the user's responses based on relevance, confidence, and communication clarity, and generates a detailed score report with suggestions for improvement.

The frontend will be built using **React.js** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The backend will be developed using **Node.js** with **Express.js**, and the AI logic (questions generation, evaluation, and feedback) will be handled through the **Gemini API**.
